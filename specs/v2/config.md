# V2 Config Review

This document breaks the legacy configuration schema into small review groups. Work through one group at a time and decide whether each field should be ported as-is, removed, or redesigned for v2.

## Status Labels

- `pending`: not discussed yet
- `keep`: port with substantially the existing meaning
- `remove`: do not carry forward
- `redesign`: keep the capability with a different shape, scope, or owning module

## Schema Scope

Use one v2 config schema for now. Some fields, such as `autoupdate`, are intended for global/user configuration, but there is not yet enough benefit to enforce that with separate global and location schemas. Revisit this if more scope-sensitive fields survive the review.

## Group 1: File Metadata

Small fields describing the config file itself rather than application behavior.

| Field     | Current Purpose                                            | Status | Notes                                                                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$schema` | JSON schema reference for editor validation and completion | keep   | Keep as read-only metadata; loading config must not insert it or create files for it. |

## Group 2: Process And Server Settings

Settings that affect process startup, shell execution, or network serving. Review global-only versus location-specific scope carefully.

| Field        | Current Purpose                                     | Status | Notes                                                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `shell`      | Default shell for terminal and shell tool execution | keep   | Port as effective config; shared shell choice is used throughout opencode.     |
| `logLevel`   | Intended logging level configuration                | remove | Do not port: no config consumer exists and logging initializes from CLI input. |
| `server`     | Hostname, port, mDNS, and CORS settings             | remove | Do not port: location config is loaded after the server is already running.    |
| `autoupdate` | Automatic update or notification behavior           | keep   | Global-only user preference; keep `true`, `false`, and `"notify"`.             |

## Group 3: Commands And Project Resources

Configuration that introduces location-scoped project resources or discoverable content.

| Field          | Current Purpose                         | Status | Notes                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `command`      | User-defined commands                   | remove | Do not port as v2 config; named reusable user workflows belong to skills.                                   |
| `skills`       | Additional skill locations              | redesign | Replace `{ paths?, urls? }` with a single array of local path or remote URL discovery sources.                           |
| `reference`    | Named git or local directory references | redesign | Rename to plural `references`; retain named local path and Git repository external-context entries.        |
| `instructions` | Additional ambient instruction sources  | keep     | Keep as one array of local paths, glob patterns, or remote URLs supplying automatically included context.   |

V2 does not expose separate user-authored command configuration. Skills should cover named reusable prompt workflows, whether invoked directly by the user or loaded by an agent. Internal command routing and built-in commands may remain runtime concerns without creating a `command` or `commands` config field.

This intentionally does not port legacy command-only behavior such as per-command `model`, `agent`, `subtask`, prompt shell expansion, or positional/template substitution. If a related capability is needed in v2, it should be designed in the owning domain rather than preserved through a second workflow definition system.

Keep `skills` as discovery-source configuration rather than inline workflow definitions. Skill content remains owned by `SKILL.md`; each `skills` entry is either a local search root or a remote discovery URL. Direct invocation behavior can be designed separately without expanding the config shape.

```jsonc
{
  "skills": ["./team-skills", "~/shared-skills", "https://example.com/.well-known/skills/"],
}
```

Keep ambient instructions separate from skills. Instructions are automatically included as model context, while skills are loaded or invoked intentionally. Each source is unambiguously either a local path/glob or a URL, so v2 keeps the simple array shape:

```jsonc
{
  "instructions": ["CONTRIBUTING.md", "docs/guidelines.md", ".cursor/rules/*.md", "https://example.com/shared-rules.md"],
}
```

Keep named external context references as a v2 configuration capability, renamed to plural `references` because it is a collection keyed by alias. References declare local directories or Git repositories that can later be addressed as `@alias` or `@alias/path` when the v2 runtime implements this behavior.

```jsonc
{
  "references": {
    "design-system": { "path": "../ui-library" },
    "sdk": { "repository": "github.com/example/sdk", "branch": "main" },
  },
}
```

Retain the compact string entry form as well: values starting with `.`, `/`, or `~` represent local paths, and other strings represent Git repositories.

## Group 4: Plugins

Plugin loading has source-path and scope-sensitive behavior, so it should be reviewed separately from other project resources.

| Field    | Current Purpose               | Status   | Notes                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plugin` | User-specified plugin modules | redesign | Rename to plural `plugins`; retain ordered loading with package strings or `{ package, options? }` entries.         |

Plugin order remains part of the v2 configuration contract because hook registration and execution can depend on load order. Replace legacy option tuples with readable object entries:

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": [
    "opencode-helicone-session",
    {
      "package": "@my-org/audit-plugin",
      "options": {
        "endpoint": "https://audit.example.com",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

The configured `plugins` list represents package-loaded plugins only. Local plugin code remains discovered from plugin directories such as `.opencode/plugins/`; v2 does not port arbitrary configured local paths or file URLs into this field.

## Group 5: Filesystem And Tool Runtime

Settings controlling local file observation, snapshots, language tooling, and tool output behavior.

| Field         | Current Purpose                         | Status  | Notes |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| `watcher`     | Ignore patterns for filesystem watching | keep     | Keep `{ ignore?: string[] }`; this configures the filesystem watcher subsystem. |
| `snapshot`    | Enable filesystem snapshot tracking     | redesign | Rename to plural `snapshots`; controls creation of snapshots used for undo and revert behavior. |
| `formatter`   | Configure formatters                    | pending |       |
| `lsp`         | Configure language servers              | pending |       |
| `attachment`  | Configure attachment/image processing   | pending |       |
| `tool_output` | Configure tool output truncation limits | pending |       |

## Group 6: Sharing And Identity

Settings affecting sharing behavior or user/account identity rather than model execution.

| Field        | Current Purpose                                 | Status  | Notes                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| `share`      | Session sharing behavior                        | pending |                                 |
| `autoshare`  | Legacy automatic sharing flag                   | pending | Deprecated in favor of `share`. |
| `enterprise` | Enterprise URL configuration                    | pending |                                 |
| `username`   | Display username in conversations and telemetry | pending |                                 |

## Group 7: Providers And Model Selection

Provider catalog customization and model-choice configuration. The new core work has started here.

| Field                | Current Purpose                                   | Status   | Notes                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider`           | Custom provider configuration and model overrides | redesign | Rename to plural `providers` in v2; do not preserve the legacy singular key. Review nested provider/model fields separately. |
| `disabled_providers` | Disable automatically loaded providers            | redesign | Replace with `experimental.policies: [{ effect: "deny", action: "provider.use", resource: "..." }]`.               |
| `enabled_providers`  | Restrict enabled providers to an allowlist        | redesign | Replace with ordered `provider.use` allow/deny statements and wildcard resources.                                       |
| `model`              | Default model selection                           | keep     | Keep as the fallback model when an active session or agent does not specify a model.                                   |
| `small_model`        | Small/utility model selection                     | remove   | Do not port; its only runtime consumer is title generation, which can use an explicit `title` agent model override.    |

Provider selection rules belong in `experimental.policies` rather than provider entries or repeated top-level provider fields. Initial proposed shape:

```jsonc
{
  "experimental": {
    "policies": [
      {
        "effect": "deny",
        "action": "provider.use",
        "resource": "*",
      },
      {
        "effect": "allow",
        "action": "provider.use",
        "resource": "anthropic",
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

See [provider-policy.md](./provider-policy.md) for the provider policy semantics and precedence rules.

Policy evaluation will consume authored config documents in reverse order while preserving statement order inside each document. The precedence of `.opencode` policy sources remains open until `.opencode` configuration is reviewed.

Provider configuration uses the plural `providers` key in v2. This intentionally differs from the legacy singular `provider` key; v2 does not add a compatibility alias while its configuration surface is still being defined.

Keep `model` as the default model fallback. It is application-wide behavior used when an active session or agent has no explicit model selection, so it does not belong inside any individual provider configuration.

Do not port `small_model`. In the current runtime it is only consulted while generating a session title: the `title` agent model wins first, then `small_model`, then automatic/current-model fallback. In v2, users who need a specific title model should configure the `title` agent directly rather than use a separate top-level model setting.

## Group 8: Agents And Permissions

Agent behavior and tool-access policy. Review together because agent configuration can contain permissions and model choices.

| Field           | Current Purpose                                     | Status  | Notes                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `default_agent` | Choose default primary agent                        | pending |                                             |
| `mode`          | Legacy agent configuration alias                    | pending | Deprecated in favor of `agent`.             |
| `agent`         | Configure primary, subagent, and specialized agents | pending |                                             |
| `permission`    | Tool permission rules                               | pending |                                             |
| `tools`         | Legacy tool enable/disable map                      | pending | Converted to permissions by current loader. |

## Group 9: Integrations

External protocol and server integration configuration.

| Field | Current Purpose                       | Status  | Notes |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| `mcp` | MCP server definitions and enablement | pending |       |

## Group 10: Conversation Lifecycle

Behavior affecting long-running conversations and context management.

| Field        | Current Purpose                                             | Status  | Notes |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| `compaction` | Automatic compaction, pruning, and context reserve settings | pending |       |

## Group 11: Deprecated And Experimental Settings

Fields that should not be ported by inertia; each needs an explicit justification.

| Field                                | Current Purpose                         | Status  | Notes                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `layout`                             | Legacy layout selection                 | pending | Deprecated; current description says stretch layout is always used. |
| `experimental.disable_paste_summary` | Disable pasted-content summary behavior | pending |                                                                     |
| `experimental.batch_tool`            | Enable batch tool                       | pending |                                                                     |
| `experimental.openTelemetry`         | Enable AI SDK telemetry spans           | pending |                                                                     |
| `experimental.primary_tools`         | Restrict tools to primary agents        | pending |                                                                     |
| `experimental.continue_loop_on_deny` | Continue loop after denied tool call    | pending |                                                                     |
| `experimental.mcp_timeout`           | MCP request timeout                     | pending | May belong with MCP rather than experiments.                        |
